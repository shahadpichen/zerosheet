# ZeroSheet

ZeroSheet is an end-to-end encrypted spreadsheet product and a hands-on enterprise IAM learning project.

The product will combine:

- Keycloak for authentication, federation, and enterprise SSO.
- OpenFGA for relationship-based authorization.
- OPA for contextual authorization policies.
- PostgreSQL for product, identity-service, and authorization-service state.
- Google Drive and Sheets for encrypted workbook storage and synchronization.

## Current milestone

Milestone 3 adds Google as an upstream identity provider brokered by Keycloak.
ZeroSheet still trusts only Keycloak's OIDC issuer, and Google login uses the
same PKCE-protected BFF flow and opaque HttpOnly product session as local login.

## Requirements

- Node.js 24
- pnpm 10
- Docker with Compose (infrastructure milestones)

## Development

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm infra:auth:up
pnpm infra:federation:google:verify
pnpm infra:db:migrate
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test
pnpm dev
```

The API listens on `http://127.0.0.1:3001` and the web application on `http://127.0.0.1:5173` by default.

With the API and web app running, `pnpm infra:oidc:verify` checks the live
PostgreSQL, Keycloak, PKCE, cookie, and redirect boundaries without printing
credential values.

Google federation starts disabled with placeholder credentials. Follow
[`docs/learning/03-google-identity-federation.md`](docs/learning/03-google-identity-federation.md)
to create a development Google OAuth client and enable interactive Google login.
